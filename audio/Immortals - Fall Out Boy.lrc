[00:09.710]They say we are what we are
[00:12.000]But we don't have to be
[00:14.190]I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way
[00:18.570]I'll be the watcher (watcher)
[00:20.610]Of the eternal flame
[00:23.000]I'll be the guard dog
[00:25.240]of all your fever dreams
[00:27.180]Oooooooh
[00:30.860]I am the sand in the bottom half
[00:33.400]Of the hourglass (glass, glass)
[00:36.030]Oooooooh
[00:39.720]I try to picture me without you but I can't
[00:43.660]'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
[00:48.490]Just not for long, for long
[00:52.290]And live with me forever now
[00:55.120]Pull the blackout curtains down
[00:57.520]Just not for long, for long
[01:01.950]Because we could be Immooooooo- Immortals
[01:07.030]Immooooooo- Immortals
[01:11.750]Immooooooo- Immortals
[01:15.880]Immooooooo- Immortals
[01:25.190]Sometimes the only pay off
[01:27.330]For having any faith
[01:29.620]Is when it's tested again and again
[01:32.660]Everyday
[01:34.060]I'm still comparing your past
[01:36.200]To my future
[01:38.440]It might be your wound
[01:39.930]but they're my sutures
[01:42.620]Oooooooh
[01:46.320]I am the sand in the bottom half
[01:48.810]Of the hourglass (glass, glass)
[01:51.500]Oooooooh
[01:55.080]I try to picture me without you but I can't
[01:59.070]'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
[02:03.950]Just not for long, for long
[02:07.440]And live with me forever now
[02:10.180]Pull the blackout curtains down
[02:12.730]Just not for long, for long
[02:17.110]Because we could be Immooooooo- Immortals
[02:22.230]Immooooooo- Immortals
[02:28.100]Immortals
[02:29.450]And live with me forever now
[02:34.130]Pull the blackout curtains down
[02:39.100]Because we could be Immortals, Immortals
[02:43.730]Just not for long, for long
[02:48.060]We could be Immooooooo- Immortals
[02:53.190]Immooooooo- Immortals
[02:57.730]Immooooooo- Immortals
[03:02.050]Immooooooo- Immortals
